# donutShop
so we were to make a donutShop in our first bascic Javascript course at Medieinstitutet fall 2022.
The assaignment is a group a group assignment, and we're doing separate parts.

For me, to understand the flow and the more basics of Javascript, I'd decided to do my own!

it's a offtime project and a work in progress, and hopefully it'll make me understand Javascript more.

Enjoy!
